# In a folder called project create two files: hotel.py and room.py
# In the room.py file, create a class called Room. Upon initialization, it should receive a number (int) and a
# capacity (int). It should also have an attribute called guests (0 by default) and is_taken (False by default).
# The class should have 2 additional methods:
# â€¢	take_room(people) - if the room is not taken, and there is enough space, the guests take the room. Otherwise,
# the method should return "Room number {number} cannot be taken"
# â€¢	free_room() - if the room is taken, free it. Otherwise, return "Room number {number} is not taken"
