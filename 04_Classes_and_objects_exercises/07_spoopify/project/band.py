# The Band class should receive a name (string) upon initialization. It also has an attribute albums (an empty list).
# The class has three methods:
# -	add_album(album: Album)
# o	Adds an album to the collection and returns "Band {band_name} has added their newest album {album_name}."
# o	If the album is already added, returns "Band {band_name} already has {album_name} in their library."
# -	remove_album(album_name: str)
# o	Removes the album from the collection and returns "Album {name} has been removed."
# o	If the album is published, returns "Album has been published. It cannot be removed."
# o	If the album is not in the collection, returns "Album {name} is not found."
# -	details()
# o	Returns the information of the band, with their albums, in this format:
# "Band {name}
#  {album details}
#  ...
#  {album details}"
